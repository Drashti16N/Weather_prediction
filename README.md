# Weather prediction
Machine Learning project on Weather Prediction.

**# Introduction:**
- Weather forecasting refers to predicting atmospheric conditions at a certain area and time using scientific methods and technology.
- Weather prediction has always been a critical aspect of our daily lives, influencing various decisions from agricultural planning to disaster management.
- Through machine learning, we can enhance the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts.
- By analyzing historical weather data and combining it with real-time observations, machine learning algorithms can provide valuable insights into weather patterns, making prediction more precisely and timely.
- Parameter used for classification of labeled data : Humidity, Precipitation, temperature, windspeed.

**# Data Source:**
- We have downloaded weather data of Dehradun of the year 2021.
